# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-ML-Models

The project involves a dataset containing 300,000 anonymized transactions, each labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Fraudulent transactions are extremely rare, accounting for less than 0.1% of the dataset. Consequently, a model that predicts all transactions as non-fraudulent could achieve an accuracy of over 99.9%, despite failing to identify any fraudulent transactions. Therefore, it's essential to implement techniques to address this imbalance.
